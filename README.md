## Overview

Real-Time Neural Network Visualizer is a project where I built a neural network from scratch, right from the definition of layers, addition of weights and biases, and randomization using a mutate function. The project's primary focus is on real-time visualization, demonstrating the functioning of the neural network.


## Features

1. **Artificial Sensors:**
   - Detection of road borders and nearby cars within a certain range.

2. **Collision Detection:**
   - The car comes to a halt upon colliding with other cars or road borders.

3. **Neural Network:**
   - Definition of layers, weights, biases, and a mutate function for optimization.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Real-time visualization of neural networks.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Parallelization of attempts made by the car for enhanced efficiency.

## Project Structure

- **visualizer.js:** Handles real-time visualization.
- **network.js:** Implements the neural network from scratch.
- **utils.js:** Contains utility functions.
- **sensor.js:** Manages artificial sensors.
- **road.js:** Implements road-related functionalities.
- **car.js:** Defines the self-moving car.
- **controls.js:** Incorporates controls for the car.
